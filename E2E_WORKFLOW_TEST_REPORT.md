**Test Status:** PASSED  
**Evidence:** API tests show complete workflow functioning correctly

**Key Findings:**
- Batch conversion API successfully processes multiple file uploads
- Enhanced folder structure analysis correctly identifies file types
- ZIP creation includes all converted content and resources
- Session management provides unique tracking IDs
- Progress streaming works correctly with detailed status updates

```

### ✅ 2. Real Browser Upload Simulation

**Test Status:** PASSED  
**Evidence:** Both `webkitRelativePath` and fallback logic tested

**Folder Upload (webkitRelativePath):**
- Preserves exact directory structure from browser folder selection
- Maintains file relationships and relative paths
- No inference needed - direct structure preservation

**Individual File Upload (fallback logic):**
- Intelligent project structure inference based on file names and types
- Proper categorization of files into MadCap directory conventions
- Examples tested:
  - `admin-guide.html` → `Content/Admin/admin-guide.html`
  - `icon-user.png` → `Content/Images/Icons/icon-user.png`
  - `General.flvar` → `Project/VariableSets/General.flvar`

### ✅ 3. Resource Discovery and Analysis

**Test Status:** PASSED  
**Evidence:** Enhanced folder structure analysis working perfectly

**File Type Detection:**
- **Content files (.html/.htm):** ✅ Correctly identified and counted
- **Image files (.png/.svg/.jpg):** ✅ Properly categorized by location
- **Snippet files (.flsnp):** ✅ Accurately detected and listed
- **Variable files (.flvar):** ✅ Properly recognized
- **TOC files (.fltoc):** ✅ Correctly identified
- **Other files:** ✅ Appropriately categorized

**Directory Analysis:**
- **Missing common directories:** Properly reported (e.g., missing `Content/Images`)
- **Present directories:** Accurately detected and logged
- **Nested structure analysis:** Works correctly up to 3 levels deep

### ✅ 4. Error Scenario Testing

**Test Status:** PASSED  
**Evidence:** Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

**Tested Scenarios:**
- **Malformed HTML files:** Gracefully handled with detailed error reporting
- **Missing image directories:** Properly detected and reported without breaking conversion
- **Permission-restricted files:** Appropriate error messages with continued processing
- **Empty uploads:** Clear validation messages
- **Invalid format requests:** Proper error responses with debugging information

**Error Handling Quality:**
- Detailed error messages with file names and specific issues
- Continued processing of valid files when some files fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging purposes
- User-friendly error reporting in API responses

### ✅ 5. Progress Tracking Validation

**Test Status:** PASSED  
**Evidence:** Real-time progress updates with resource copying status

**Progress Events Monitored:**
- **conversion_start:** Initial analysis with resource summary
- **file_start:** Individual file processing begins
- **file_progress:** Real-time conversion status
- **file_complete:** Individual file completion confirmation
- **Resource copying status:** Included in progress metadata

**Session Management:**
- Unique session IDs generated for each conversion
- Progress state maintained throughout conversion process
- Final completion events include comprehensive resource summary
- Error sessions properly handled and reported

### ✅ 6. Resource Copying Verification

**Test Status:** PASSED  
**Evidence:** All image directories discovered and copied correctly

**Image Directory Discovery:**
The enhanced `copyImageDirectories()` method successfully discovers and processes:
- ✅ `Content/Images/` → consolidated to `Images/`
- ✅ `Content/Resources/Images/` → consolidated to `Images/`
- ✅ `Resources/Images/` → consolidated to `Images/`
- ✅ `Resources/Multimedia/` → consolidated to `Images/`
- ✅ Subdirectory preservation (Icons, Screens, Branding)

**Resource Copying Process:**
```
🔍 === IMAGE DIRECTORY DISCOVERY ===
📂 Source root: [input directory]
📂 Target root: [output directory]
🔍 Checking: Content/Images -> [full path]
✅ Found image directory: Content/Images
📂 Copying image directory: Content/Images -> Images
✅ Successfully copied image directory: Content/Images
📊 Image copying results:
  - Copied directories: 1 (Content/Images)
  - Errors: 0
  - Overall success: true
```

**Consolidated Approach:**
- All discovered image directories are consolidated into a single `Images/` folder in output
- No duplicate copying occurs - flag management prevents repeated operations
- Directory structure within images is preserved (Icons/, Screens/, etc.)

### ✅ 7. API Response Analysis

**Test Status:** PASSED  
**Evidence:** Enhanced headers provide comprehensive metadata

**Enhanced Headers Analysis:**

**X-Conversion-Summary:**
```json
{
  "totalFiles": 4,
  "convertedFiles": 4,
  "skippedFiles": 0,
  "errors": 0,
  "resourceCopying": {
    "imagesCopied": true,
    "totalImages": 5,
    "resourcesIncluded": 2
  }
}
```

**X-Resource-Status:**
```json
{
  "input": {
    "totalFiles": 17,
    "snippetFiles": 2,
    "imageFiles": 5,
    "contentFiles": 4
  },
  "output": {
    "totalFiles": 19,
    "imageFiles": 5,
    "convertedFiles": 4
  },
  "inference": {
    "usedFallbackStructure": false,
    "missingDirectories": ["Project"]
  }
}
```

**Metadata Quality:**
- Comprehensive file counting and categorization
- Clear distinction between input and output analysis
- Inference information for debugging upload scenarios
- Resource copying status for user feedback
