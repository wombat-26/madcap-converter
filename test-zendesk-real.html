        <h1 class="zendesk-heading">Adding Calculated Costs</h1>
        <p>Sometimes the amount to be entered is not fixed for Sheila, for example because she has to enter a yearly amount month by month or she has to calculate a total amount from several parts. Sheila doesn't have to do her calculation with a calculator first; she can do her calculations directly as she enters them.</p>
        <details class="zendesk-collapsible"><summary><strong>Calculator Capabilities</strong></summary><div class="collapsible-content">
                <div class="snippet-content"><p>You can add, subtract, multiply and divide in the cells and insert parentheses. This is possible for direct entries in the grid as well as for entries of amounts in another currency (see <a href="../Doku/05-3-4 SettMultCurrVal.htm">Setting a Multi-Currency Value</a>).</p>
        <p>It is important that you start the input with an equal sign for a calculation. For example, if you want to add the amounts 456.99, 856.45 and 89.74, the correct entry is:</p><pre xml:space="preserve" class="zendesk-code">=456.99+856.45+89.74</pre>
        <p>Without the equal sign the input is not understood and cannot be calculated.</p>
        <p>If you enter an incomplete calculation or have an error in the formula syntax the cell will be outlined in red, and the calculation will not be complete. The box will be outlined in green after you have entered a valid calculation.</p>
        <div class="warning">
            <p><span class="warningInDiv">Attention</span>
            </p>
            <p>Uptempo does not record the formula, so once the calculation is complete there is no way to see the original equation.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The result of a calculation is always displayed rounded to two decimal places. </p></div></div></details>
        <details class="zendesk-collapsible"><summary><strong>Example: Adding Calculated Costs</strong></summary><div class="collapsible-content">
                <div class="snippet-content"><div class="example">
            <p>You need to enter the sum of the following amounts in a cell: 260.56, 378.89 and one third of the amount 951.23.</p>
            <p>You click on the cell and enter:</p>
            <p>= 260.56+378.89+951.23/3</p>
            <p>When you press Enter, the result 956.33 is displayed.</p>
