====

The image:../Images/GUI-Elemente/Link Activity.png[Link Activity,18] _Link_ button may be unavailable for some investment items to indicate that they can't be connected to the activity. Whether an investment can be connected to a particular activity is controlled by the rules that have been set up in your Uptempo environment.
====

The _Select Investment Item_ dialog closes. You are returned to the activity's *Budget* page, which now contains additional subsections that display spend data for the connected investment:
